Your best friend, a distant relative of the recently deceased owner,
inherited this mansion after the owner's mysterious death. During a
visit, however, your friend went missing, and no one seems to know 
where they are. It's up to you to enter the mansion, search for your 
friend, and rescue them from whatever dark forces may lurk within...
Let the adventure begin!

You stand before the old, creaky front door of the mansion. The air 
is thick with a strange, unsettling chill. The door groans as you push 
it open, revealing a dimly lit hallway with two paths ahead: the living 
room or the dining room.

You enter the living room.
The room is dark and filled with dust. A sleeping monster, half-lion, 
half-pitbull, lays guarding a pile of shimmering jewelry. Your heart 
races as you spot your friend locked in a cage behind the beast, the 
large lock glinting in the low light. Among the pile of treasure, there
is a key. Perhaps it will open the cage. But stealing the key would 
mean risking the monster's wrath.

You enter the dining room.
The room is eerily quiet, save for the faint ticking of a distant clock. 
On a table in the center of the room sits a shiny vase, its surface glinting 
like it holds something valuable. Something about it feels off.

You open the vase and find an axe inside.
The axe feels surprisingly heavy in your hands. It may be the weapon you need 
to face whatever dangers lie ahead. After taking the axe, you decide to head 
over to the living room.

You decide not to open the shiny vase.
As you turn to leave, a sudden cracking noise comes from the corner of the room. 
Before you can react, a dark figure with glowing red eyes leaps at you, knocking 
you unconscious. You wake up in your bed. It was all a dream.
