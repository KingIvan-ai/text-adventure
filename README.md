Text Adventure Project

Summary:
This project is a simple text-based adventure game where players explore a mansion in search of their missing friend. Along the way, players face choices, combat monsters, and solve puzzles to progress through the narrative.

The game is implemented in Python and follows modular programming principles. It features multiple files for game logic (text-adventure.py), combat mechanics (combat.py), narrative content (rooms.txt), and result storage (saveResult.txt). The combat system uses dice-based mechanics, and the gameâ€™s outcomes depend on player decisions.

How to Run:
Run the text-adventure.py file to start the game.
Ensure all files (combat.py, rooms.txt, and saveResult.txt) are in the same directory as text-adventure.py.
Python 3.x is required to execute this project.

Features:
Modular game logic split into multiple files.
Dice-based combat mechanics.
Interactive story progression based on player choices.

Requirements:
Python 3.x installed on your machine.
